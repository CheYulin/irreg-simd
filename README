Notes on data preparation:
Option1: 
    One time execution and build the input for all applications, run data-preparation.sh 
Option2: 
    We have splitted the data-preparation.sh into different scripts, one for each application type.
    + data-preparation-irregular.sh is for generating and transforming inputs for irregular
      reductions, including Moldyn and Euler.
    + data-preparation-graph.sh is for generating and transforming inputs for graph applications,
      including PageRank and SSSP.
    + data-preparation-spmm.sh is for downloading inputs for SpMM, including float and double
      executions.
