gen.c

This program is originally part of moldyn. Since generating input
takes very long time, we took out the input generation part and
save the interaction list and coordinates of molecules.

USAGE:

  % gen < gen.in

INPUT:

  % cat gen.in
  32	<----- BOXSIZE determines number of molecules.
  3.5   <----- cutoff determines sparsity of interaction list.
