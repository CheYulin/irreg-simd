<p>A broad class of applications involve indirect or datadependent
memory accesses and are referred to as irregular
applications. Recent developments in SIMD architectures
– specifically, the emergence of wider SIMD lanes,
combination of SIMD parallelism with many-core MIMD
parallelism, and more flexible programming APIs – are providing
new opportunities as well as challenges for this class
of applications. In this paper, we propose a general opti-
mization methodology, to effectively optimize different subclasses
of irregular applications. Based on the observation
that all applications with indirect memory accesses can be
viewed as sparse matrix computations, we design an optimization
methodology, which includes three sub-steps: 1)
locality enhancement through tiling, 2) data access pattern
identification, and 3) write conflict removal at both SIMD
and MIMD levels. This method has been applied to unstructured
grids, molecular dynamics, and graph applications,
in addition to sparse matrix computations. The speedups
achieved by our single threaded vectorized code over serial
code is up to 9.05, whereas the overall speedup while utilizing
both SIMD and MIMD (61 cores in Intel Xeon Phi)
with our approach is up to 467.1. Further optimization using
matrix reordering on irregular reductions and graph algorithms
is able to achieve an incremental speedup of up to
1.69, though at a relatively high preprocessing cost. Moreover,
SpMM using our approach outperforms routines from
a highly optimized commercial library by up to 2.81x.</p>
